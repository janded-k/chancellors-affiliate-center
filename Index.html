        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">I know of a man who was to be awarded a contract in another city. He was to travel by air. When he arrived at the airport, his flight was delayed.
            Then after about two hours he was told the flight was cancelled because of some fault in the aircraft engine. He was given another flight, but he arrived late so he missed the contract.

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">Stick with me</p>
        <p>In August this year, my grandmother had a surgery in her right knee. Then she was to come back by air. But her flight was delayed for several hours.
            she later got home in the evening when it was already dark, while climbing the stairs that night. She missed a step and fell down. She broke her left leg in two places. That night was terrible.
        </p>
        <p>You might be thinking but private jets are expensive.The truth is boarding a private jet is far more better than being in a business class with a public flight. One of the benefits of travelling with
            our private jet is that you fly unscheduled. That is, you choose the time you want to travel. And this is done with Maximum comfort and Luxury. Also, Our prices are affordable.</p>
